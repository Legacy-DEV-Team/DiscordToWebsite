## Discord To Website

This project, **Discord To Website**, is a Node.js application developed by **Legacy DEV Team**. It allows websites to fetch user data (such as username, discriminator, and avatar) from Discord using the Discord ID through a simple API.

## Features
- Fetch Discord user information based on the Discord ID.
- Exposes an API to retrieve the user's username, discriminator, and avatar URL.
- Developed using **Node.js** with **discord.js** and **Express**.
- Easy to integrate into your website.
- MIT License.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Legacy-DEV-Team/DiscordToWebsite.git
    cd DiscordToWebsite
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your **Discord Bot Token**:
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new bot.
   - Copy the **Bot Token** and replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` in the `bot.js` file.

4. Run the bot:

    ```bash
    node bot.js
    ```

5. The API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`. You can now use the endpoint:

    GET /get_user_info?discord_id=DISCORD_USER_ID
    ```
